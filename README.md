# Template Engine

## Description

This a command line application that generates an HTML file containing a profile for an engineering team. The user is prompted to input the team manager's information, followed by any number of employees' information. That information is then used to generate the HTML file.

## Prerequisites

- inquirer ^6.3.1
- jest ^24.8.0

```
npm install inquirer
```
```
npm install jest
```


## Running the tests

```
npm run test
```
To run the test files that determine the employee objects are working properly.

## Deployment
```
node app.js
```
This is the command line input to start the application.

## Conde Snipets
```
function createEmployeeObject(info,type){
    if(type === "Manager"){
        let manager = new Manager(info.name, info.id , info.email, info.officeNumber);
        employees.push(manager);
    } else if (type === "Engineer"){
        let engineer = new Engineer(info.name, info.id, info.email, info.github);
        employees.push(engineer);
    } else if (type === "Intern"){
        let intern = new Intern(info.name, info.id, info.email, info.school);
        employees.push(intern);
    }
};
```
All the employee information is gathered using inquirer prompts. That information is then passed to the this function which then creates an object based on the type of employee that was passed to the function. The employee object is then pushed into a global array that stores all the employee objects.

```
let htmlMiddle = ``;

//an id for css styling
let id = "";

for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if (i<=1){
        id = "id2"
    } else if(i === 2) {
        id = "id3"
    } else {
        id = "id4"
    }

    if(array[i] instanceof Manager){
        htmlMiddle += generateManagerCard(array[i]); 
    } else if(array[i] instanceof Engineer){
        htmlMiddle += generateEngineerCard(array[i],id);
    } else if(array[i] instanceof Intern){
        htmlMiddle += generateInternCard(array[i],id);
    }
}

htmlFile = htmlTop + htmlMiddle + htmlEnd;

return htmlFile;
```
This is a portion of the function that generates the HTML template. A for loop is used to iterate through each object in the employees array. Depending on the what type of object it is, a different HTML card template is generated. All the card templates are concatenated into a single "htmlMiddle" variable. The "htmlTop" and "htmlBottom" variables contain hardcoded HTML templates. The three variables are concatenated in order, and stored into a single variable "htmlFile". The function then returns the full template which is later used by a different function that writes the HTML file.
